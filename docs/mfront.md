# Using MFront behaviors

This page discusses the main aspects of using MFront behaviors within `dolfinx_materials`.

## What is MFront ?

[MFront](https://thelfer.github.io/tfel/web/) is a code generation tool dedicated to material knowledge {cite:p}`helfer2015introducing`. It uses various Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) to implement material properties and mechanical behaviors which are then translated into efficient C++ code. MFront provides interfaces to various finite-element solvers such as [Abaqus](https://www.3ds.com/products/simulia/abaqus), [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/), [Cast3M](http://www-cast3m.cea.fr/), [Code_Aster](https://code-aster.org/), etc.

In the following, we focus essentially on mechanical or generalized behaviors. 

Using a mechanical behavior generated by MFront consists in essentially 3 steps:

* Writing the MFront behavior in the form of a `*.mfront` file format
* Generating/compiling the shared library containing the mechanical behavior using MFront.
* Loading the relevant material model on the solver side.

For instance, a very simple `Plasticity.mfront` file corresponding to small-strain isotropic J2 plasticity with hardening would read:

```
@DSL IsotropicPlasticMisesFlow; //< domain specific language
@Behaviour Plasticity;             //< name of the behaviour
@Parameter  H  = 22e9;             //< hardening slope
@Parameter s0 = 200e6;             //< elasticity limit
@FlowRule{                         //< flow rule
  f       = seq-H*p-s0;
  df_dseq = 1;
  df_dp   = -H;
}
```
which assumes linear isotropic elasticity and translates the following plastic yield condition:

$$
f(\boldsymbol{\sigma};p) = \sigma_\text{eq} - \sigma_0 - Hp \leq 0
$$
where $\sigma_\text{eq}$ is the von Mises equivalent stress, $\sigma_0$ the initial yield stress and $H$ the hardening modulus.

The latter is then processed by MFront to generate C++ code (here approximately 1500 lines) and compiled into dynamic shared libraries.

```bash
mfront --obuild --interface=aster Plasticity.mfront
```

Where `interface` specifies the solver interface for which we want to compile the behavior, here `Code_Aster` for instance.

## Interacting with `FEniCSx`

For a generic interaction with other solvers, such as open-source or home-made codes, the [MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport (MGIS) project](https://github.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport) provides a generic interface for interacting with compiled MFront behaviors under various languages such as `python`, `c`, `fortran`, `julia`, etc. {cite:p}`helfer2020mfrontgenericinterfacesupport`

For interacting with `FEniCSx`, we rely on the MGIS python interface.

### Prerequisites

To be able to work with a `MFrontMaterial` you must therefore:

* install the TFEL project by following the [installation instructions](https://thelfer.github.io/tfel/web/install.html) 
* install the MGIS project by following the [installation instructions](https://thelfer.github.io/mgis/web/install.html). You must enable the Python bindings.

```{attention}
Installing these projects requires the Boost and Boost-Python libraries.
```

### Compilation with the `generic` interface

To be used a MFront behavior must first be compiled using here the `generic` interface:

```bash
mfront --obuild --interface=generic Plasticity.mfront
```

You should see two folders names two `include` and `src` appear, containing the generated dynamic libraries.

### Loading with `dolfinx_materials`

`dolfinx_materials` provides a `MFrontMaterial` class to load the relevant behavior to be used in a `QuadratureMap` object, similarly to a `JAXMaterial`. In particular, if a MFront behavior does not implement explicit values for the different material parameters, the latter must be provided to `MFrontMaterial` using a `material_properties` dictionary, see for instance [the `MFrontMaterial` documentation](/docs/api/material.rst) or the [](/demos/mfront/finite_strain_elastoplasticity/finite_strain_elastoplasticity.md) demo. 

## MFront demos

MFront demos contain examples on how to set up a `FEniCSx` interacting with a `MFront` behavior. They can be split into two main categories:

* demos dealing with mechanical behaviors i.e. stress/strain behaviors, such as:
    - [](/demos/mfront/finite_strain_elastoplasticity/finite_strain_elastoplasticity.md)
    - [](/demos/mfront/hyperelasticity/hyperelasticity.md)

* demos dealing with generalized (multiphysics) behaviors such as:
    - [](/demos/mfront/heat_transfer/nonlinear_heat_transfer.md)
    - [](/demos/mfront/heat_transfer/phase_change.md)
